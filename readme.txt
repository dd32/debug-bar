Adds a debug menu to the admin bar that shows query, cache, and other helpful debugging information.

== Description ==

Adds a debug menu to the admin bar that shows query, cache, and other helpful debugging information.

A must for developers!

When `WP_DEBUG` is enabled it also tracks PHP Warnings and Notices to make them easier to find.

When `SAVEQUERIES` is enabled the mysql queries are tracked and displayed.

To enable these options, add the following code to your `wp-config.php` file:
`
define( 'WP_DEBUG', true );
define( 'SAVEQUERIES', true );
`

Add a PHP/MySQL console with the [Debug Bar Console plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/debug-bar-console/).

There are numerous other add-ons available to get more insight into, for instance, the registered Post Types, Shortcodes, WP Cron, Language file loading, Actions and Filters and so on. Just [search the plugin directory for 'Debug Bar'](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/debug+bar/).
